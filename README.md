# ðŸ“˜ Mastering File Handling in C
---

## ðŸ”¹ Basics (Must-Do)

1. âœ… Open a file in read mode and print its contents.
2. âœ… Open a file in write mode and write a string to it.
3. âœ… Append text to an existing file.
4. âœ… Count the number of characters, words, and lines in a file.
5. âœ… Copy content from one file to another.
6. âœ… Merge two text files into a third file.
7. âœ… Compare two files line by line and print the first mismatch.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Character & Line Level Operations

8. âœ… Read and print characters one by one using `fgetc()`.
9. âœ… Read a file line by line using `fgets()` and print it.
10. âœ… Replace a specific word in a file.
11. âœ… Delete a specific line from a file.
12. âœ… Insert a line at a specific position in a file.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Formatted Input/Output

13. âœ… Read and write integers using `fprintf()` and `fscanf()`.
14. âœ… Store student records (name, marks) in a file and read them back.
15. âœ… Calculate the average marks of all students from a file.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Random Access File Operations

16. âœ… Read a file using `fseek()`, `ftell()`, and `rewind()`.
17. âœ… Modify a specific record using `fseek()`.
18. âœ… Find the size of a file using `fseek()` and `ftell()`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Binary File Handling

19. âœ… Write a structure (e.g., employee) to a binary file using `fwrite()`.
20. âœ… Read and display structure data using `fread()`.
21. âœ… Update a record in a binary file.
22. âœ… Search for a record in a binary file.
23. âœ… Delete a record from a binary file.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Error Handling and File Modes

24. âœ… Try opening a non-existing file and handle errors using `perror()` / `strerror()`.
25. âœ… Demonstrate difference between `r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`, `w+`, `a+` modes.
26. âœ… Check if a file exists before opening.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Concepts

27. âœ… Read and write encrypted data to a file (basic Caesar cipher).
28. âœ… Count frequency of each word in a file.
29. âœ… Convert all lowercase to uppercase in a file and save to a new file.
30. âœ… Maintain a simple database with add, delete, modify, search options (menu driven).
31. âœ… Sort contents of a file (e.g., names, numbers).

## ðŸ“‚ How to Use

- Each program is written in C and follows clean, commented code style.
- Compile using any C compiler (e.g., `gcc file.c -o file`).
- Run as: `./file`
- All file paths used are relative, change as needed.
